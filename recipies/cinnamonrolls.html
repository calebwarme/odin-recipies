    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first time I made these easy cinnamon rolls, I made a mess and they STILL turned out! They are gone in 2 days at my house. Simple to make and super yummy. It takes only 25 minutes of prep time and 25 total cooking time. With a litte extra time to let the dough rise, after 2 hours and 20 minutes you'll have some of the best tasting cinnamon rolls!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pound frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, and extra as needed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sifted confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lightly grease 2 round cake pans with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll bread dough out to an 6x18-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter. Combine brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over butter.

Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour heavy cream over dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>
